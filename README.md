# 💻 C++ Projects

A growing collection of my C++ programs, from foundational school assignments to more advanced applications focused on system-level logic and performance.

---

## 🧠 Project Progression

This repo tracks my journey through:
- 📘 **Beginner Programs** – Basic I/O, loops, and functions
- 🧮 **Intermediate Projects** – Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues), file operations, and class-based design
- ⚙️ **Advanced Builds** – System-level tools and performance-oriented applications

---

## 🧰 Focus Areas
- Efficient use of memory and pointers
- Terminal-based utilities and menu systems
- Algorithm implementation and optimization
- Data structure practice

---

## 📁 Structure (Coming Soon)
Each project includes:
- Description and objective
- How to compile and run
- Sample output or screenshots

---

## 🌱 Still Evolving
C++ has sharpened my understanding of how computers really work. I revisit these projects to improve structure, optimize logic, and experiment with new concepts.
